Mental Health Treatment Recommendation System

Using Gradient Boosting & Machine Learning

Abstract

This project presents a Machine Learning–based Mental Health Treatment Recommendation System.
It predicts whether an individual may require mental health treatment based on demographic,
employment, and workplace-related factors using a Gradient Boosting Classifier, achieving
79.7% accuracy.

Features
• Predicts treatment requirement likelihood
• Gradient Boosting model
• Flask-based deployment-ready API
• Clean preprocessing pipeline
• Visualizations: Heatmap, ROC, Precision–Recall
• 80–20 Train-test split

Tech Stack
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Flask, Matplotlib

Dataset Details
• 1,265 rows, 27 columns
• Preprocessing: missing value handling, encoding, scaling, outlier treatment
• Includes demographic + workplace mental health survey data

Methodology
1. Data Collection
2. Preprocessing (cleaning, encoding, scaling)
3. Model Building (GB, RF, DT, LR, SVM)
4. Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1, MSE

Results
The Gradient Boosting model achieved:
• 79.7% accuracy
• Strong ROC & PR performance
• Reliable classification ability

Conclusion
Machine learning can effectively support early detection of mental health needs. The model
shows strong predictive ability and potential for use in scalable organizational applications.

Future Scope
• Larger datasets
• Deep learning models
• Real-time prediction
• Dashboards & mobile integration
• Adaptive learning systems
